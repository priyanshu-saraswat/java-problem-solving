## About

This repository serves as a resource for Java developers to explore and understand efficient solutions to common programming problems. Each solution is accompanied by a README file providing a problem description and the approach taken to solve it.

## Repository Structure

- **solutions/**: Contains subdirectories for each solved problem, each with its own README file and Java solution file.
- **resources/**: Optional directory for any shared resources or additional materials.

## How to Use

1. **Explore**: Navigate to the `solutions/` directory to browse through solved problems.
2. **Learn**: Open a subdirectory to read the problem description and study the implemented solution in the README and Java files respectively.


## Programs

| Program Title                                     | Description                                             |
|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| sleepIn    | Determines whether you can sleep in based on two boolean inputs: weekday and vacation. It provides a simple decision-making process using conditional logic to decide the output|
| RedTicket    | Calculates the outcome of a red lottery ticket based on three integer inputs: a, b, and c. Each integer can be 0, 1, or 2. The program applies specific rules using conditional logic to determine the result|
|SumLimit|Calculates a result based on two non-negative integer inputs: a and b. The program adds the two integers and checks the number of digits in the sum. If the number of digits in the sum is the same as the number of digits in a, it returns the sum; otherwise, it returns a|
|FizzString|Determines a result based on the input string. It uses conditional logic to check if the string starts with the letter "f" and/or ends with the letter "b". Depending on these conditions, it returns "Fizz", "Buzz", "FizzBuzz", or the original string|
|MakeTags|Generates an HTML string with a specified tag and word. It uses simple string concatenation to create the HTML tag structure.|
|Without Ten|This Java program takes an array of integers as input and removes any occurrences of the number 10|
|Zero Front|This Java program takes an array of integers as input and moves all 0s to the front of the array|
|Max Mirror|This Java program calculates the size of the largest "mirror" section in an array. A mirror section in an array is a subarray that is mirrored or appears in reverse elsewhere in the array. The program finds the largest such mirror section and returns its length|
