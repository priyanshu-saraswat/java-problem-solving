# Java Problem Solving: Solutions

Welcome to the solutions directory of java-problem-solving! This directory contains solutions to various programming practice problems solved using Java. Each problem solution is organized into its own subdirectory, where you can find detailed descriptions and implementations.

## Structure

- Each problem solution is stored in its own subdirectory named after the problem title.
- Inside each subdirectory, you will find:
  - `README.md`: A detailed description of the problem statement and solution approach.
  - `.java`: Java implementation of the solution.

## How to Use

1. **Explore**: Navigate through the subdirectories to find problems you are interested in.
2. **Learn**: Open the `README.md` file inside each subdirectory to understand the problem statement and study the solution approach.
3. **Implement**: Review the `Solution.java` file to see how the problem was solved in Java.
