### Java Program: FizzString

## Description

This Java program, named "FizzString", determines a result based on the input string. It uses conditional logic to check if the string starts with the letter "f" and/or ends with the letter "b". Depending on these conditions, it returns "Fizz", "Buzz", "FizzBuzz", or the original string.

## How It Works

The program prompts the user to input a string:
- `str`: The input string.

Using this input, the program calls a method `fizzString(String str)` to compute the result. The method performs the following checks:
1. If the string starts with the letter "f" and ends with the letter "b", it returns "FizzBuzz".
2. If the string starts with the letter "f", it returns "Fizz".
3. If the string ends with the letter "b", it returns "Buzz".
4. If none of the above conditions are met, it returns the original string.

The program then displays the computed result to the user based on the provided input.

## Example

### Input:
```java
Enter a string: fab
```

### Output:
```
The result is: FizzBuzz
```

This program demonstrates the use of string manipulation and conditional logic in Java to solve a simple text-based problem.
