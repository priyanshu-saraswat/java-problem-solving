# Max Mirror Section in Array

## Description

This Java program calculates the size of the largest "mirror" section in an array. A mirror section in an array is a subarray that is mirrored or appears in reverse elsewhere in the array. The program finds the largest such mirror section and returns its length.

## How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter the size of the array.
2. The user then inputs the elements of the array.
3. The method `maxMirror(int[] nums)` is called, which:
   - Iterates through the array to find mirror sections by comparing subarrays.
   - Compares elements starting from different points in the array and counts matching pairs of elements in reverse order.
   - Keeps track of the maximum length of any mirror section found.
4. The size of the largest mirror section is then printed.

## Example

### Input:
```
Enter the size of the array: 7
Enter the elements of the array:
1 2 3 8 3 2 1
```

### Output:
```
Size of the largest mirror section: 3
```

In this example, the largest mirror section is `[1, 2, 3]`.

## Key Points
- The method `maxMirror` works by comparing subarrays starting from different positions and finding matching sections that are mirrored.
- It can handle arrays with arbitrary integer values and will always return the length of the largest mirrored section, if one exists.
